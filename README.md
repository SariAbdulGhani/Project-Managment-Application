A minimal project-management app built with React to practice state management and component structuring. You can create & delete projects, select a project, and add & delete tasks within each project.

**Features:**

  ➕ Create projects
  
  🗂️ Select an active project to work on
  
  ✅ Add tasks to the selected project
  
  ❌ Delete tasks and delete entire projects
  
  🧠 Focus on React state flow, lifting state, and prop drilling trade-offs

**Why this repo exists?**

This app is intentionally small and UI-light so the spotlight stays on:
    
    Clear state ownership (which component owns what)
    
    Lifting state up vs. component locality
    
    Immutable updates and predictable rendering
    
    Clean component boundaries and reuse
